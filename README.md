# Simple game AI
## A stupidly-simple "chasing" algoritm

### Overview
This HTML5 game demonstrates a few techniques for web-based gaming:
- JavaScript animation loop (this should optimally use _requestAnimationFrame()_ but for simplicity it's a bare-bones implementation
- Keyboard input for directional program control
- grid-based pursuit of a cop running-down a robber (you're the robber)...if the cop's image covers the robber, you've lost.
